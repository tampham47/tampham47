            <p>
              quoine has been growing exponentially. when i first joined,
              the front-end team had 3 members only. now we are 12 members strong,
              half of which i interviewed. i was ruined that team while
              i am in head of frontend position.
            </p>

            <h4>senior front-end engineer, mkt tech (oct 2018 - present)</h4>
            <p>
              focusing on marketing technology.
              working with third parties such as hubspot to leverage productivity.

            </p>

            <h4>head of front-end (apr 2018 - sep 2018)</h4>
            <p>released liquid, a new trading platform that is the combination of quoinex and qryptos. in particular, the front-end side of liquid is the fruit of labor from the cross-border efforts of quoine front-end team, based half in vietnam and half in japan.</p>
            <p>liquid landing page is built with jamstack technologies (https://jamstack.org) that is designed for seo and of which i am a fan. as a result, the landing page scores over 80 points by google search engine a few months after launching.</p>

            <h4>frontend engineer (apr 2017 - mar 2018)</h4>
            <p>helped build the quoinex platform from scratch and gained in-depth understanding about multiple functionalities of the existing platforms. worked with react, redux, and isolated css components.</p>

            <p>
              i have learned much from naustudio‚Äôs cto, mr. tran trong thanh. in particular, how to skeleton html structure and style css for easy maintenance. friday sharing weekly is a tradition at naustudio where we share and connect. here, we grow the same way we build our products.
            </p>
            <p>notable projects that i worked on at naustudio include greenbot and recpic.</p>

            <h4>greenbot</h4>
            <p>a combination of biology and it, the project uses iot to grow hydroponic vegetables. apart from being the main js developer, i also helped transform the design into the application layout. the project provided good experience with mqtt and strong-loop.</p>

            <h4>recpic</h4>
            <p>recpic is a korean startup project that helps manage expenses by capturing receipts. it was handed over from another agency and developed with angular. i built several new features and maintained the existing application. eventually due to political changes, the project was no longer supported by the government.</p>

              the most notable project in this period is wequit, a social network about quitting smoking. the project extended over 8 months during which i was the main js developer. we used phonegap, the outstanding tool at the time, to build a cross-platform application (ios and android) for this social network. managing big source code with angular 1.0 and great animations are what i learned from this project.
