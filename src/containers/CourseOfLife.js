                  Quoine has been growing exponentially. When I first joined,
                  the Front-end team had 3 members only. Now we are 12 members strong,
                  half of which I interviewed. I was ruined that team while
                  I am in head of frontend position.

                <p>Liquid landing page is built with JAMstack technologies (https://jamstack.org) that is designed for SEO and of which I am a fan. As a result, the landing page scores over 80 points by Google search engine a few months after launching.</p>

                <p>Helped build the Quoinex platform from scratch and gained in-depth understanding about multiple functionalities of the existing platforms. Worked with React, Redux, and isolated CSS components.</p>

                  I have learned much from Naustudio‚Äôs CTO, Mr. Tran Trong Thanh. In particular, how to skeleton HTML structure and style CSS for easy maintenance. Friday sharing weekly is a tradition at Naustudio where we share and connect. Here, we grow the same way we build our products.
                </p>
                <p>Notable projects that I worked on at Naustudio include Greenbot and Recpic.</p>

                <h4>Greenbot</h4>
                <p>A combination of biology and IT, the project uses IOT to grow hydroponic vegetables. Apart from being the main JS developer, I also helped transform the design into the application layout. The project provided good experience with MQTT and Strong-loop.</p>

                <h4>Recpic</h4>
                <p>Recpic is a Korean startup project that helps manage expenses by capturing receipts. It was handed over from another agency and developed with Angular. I built several new features and maintained the existing application. Eventually due to political changes, the project was no longer supported by the government.</p>

                  The most notable project in this period is Wequit, a social network about quitting smoking. The project extended over 8 months during which I was the main JS developer. We used PhoneGap, the outstanding tool at the time, to build a cross-platform application (iOS and Android) for this social network. Managing big source code with Angular 1.0 and great animations are what I learned from this project.

                <p>I also contribute to several open-source projects.</p>
                <h4>Jukebox</h4>
                <p>A music sharing application to be used at work. The app remains in use at Naustudio where people can book the song they want to listen and a host will play them in order. It was built with Meteor, with realtime as default.</p>
